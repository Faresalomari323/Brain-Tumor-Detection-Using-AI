This project demonstrates how AI technologies—especially deep
learning—can make a real difference in the medical field by
assisting in the early detection of brain tumors with high accuracy
and speed. By using MRI data and neural network models, it's
possible to reduce sole reliance on manual diagnosis and improve
early treatment outcomes, ultimately saving lives. We look forward
to further development and integration of such systems into
healthcare environments.
